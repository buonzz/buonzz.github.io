<p>I used to be a Visual Basic Programmer at first before I become a Web Developer. Thus, I almost touched all aspects of programming starting from Desktop programming to Web-based development. You can check out all my sample projects below, and a little description of what kind of project is that and might some time include the technology used to do that particular project.</p>
