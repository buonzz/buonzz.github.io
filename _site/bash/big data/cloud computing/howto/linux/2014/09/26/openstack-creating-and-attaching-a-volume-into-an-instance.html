  <article class="post-content">
    <p>In physical servers, whenever you need to add additional storage capacity in a server, what you usually do is physically put a faster and better hard drive in the the physical server itself, then you will setup some RAID configuration and etc to make sure the storage device is secure and provides data redundancy to prevent loss of data.</p>
<p>Gone are those days, because unlike attaching a physical hard disk, OpenStack allows you to create a virtual storage device (volumes) that you can attach in to your virtual machines (Instance).</p>
<p>Now let's get started on creating the first Volume.</p>
<p>In the OpenStack dashboard, click the Volumes menu under Project.<br />
<a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/15.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1369" src="assets/15.png" alt="1" width="226" height="315" /></a></p>
<p>Click the "Create Volume" button on the top right side.<br />
the dialog opens and asks for the volume information you want to create. Let's say we wanted to create a volume to store the files that are going to serve by Nginx.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/31.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1370" src="assets/31.png" alt="3" width="689" height="550" /></a></p>
<p>Note: The type and Availability Zone parameters may vary depending on your Cloud Provider.</p>
<p>Once you had filled up the information, click the "Create Volume" button.<br />
It should be now listed in the Volumes table.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you get an error when creating a Volume, try lowering the size</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that you had a Volume created, how do you actually use this to a VM instance to create files?</p>
<p>First, you need to have a working Instance and you should be able to connect to it via SSH. If you haven't configured a VM instance yet, please read my article about <a title="How to SSH to the VM instance in OpenStack" href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/how-to-ssh-to-the-vm-instance-in-openstack/" target="_blank">How to SSH to the VM instance in OpenStack</a>.</p>
<p>To attach the Volume into an instance, click the More dropdown button in the Actions column of your Volume:<br />
<a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1372" src="assets/4.png" alt="4" width="200" height="201" /></a></p>
<p>Click "Edit Attachments", you will see a dialog like this<br />
<a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/51.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1373" src="assets/51.png" alt="5" width="688" height="446" /></a></p>
<p>In my example, I have a Debian instance called "webserver1", so I just selected it and hit the "Attach Volume" button.</p>
<p>You will see now in the "Attached To" column that the volume is attached into "webserver1" instance, in a device called "/dev/vdc1"<br />
<a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/61.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1375" src="assets/61.png" alt="6" width="159" height="105" /></a></p>
<p>Now let's login to webserver1 instance as root.</p>
<p>To verify if the volume was attached properly, execute:</p>
<pre lang="bash">fdisk -l
</pre>
<p>Somewhere on the output, you should see some message like this:</p>
<pre>Disk /dev/vdc: 10.7 GB, 10737418240 bytes
16 heads, 63 sectors/track, 20805 cylinders, total 20971520 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes

I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x00000000

Disk /dev/vdc doesn't contain a valid partition table
</pre>
<p>If you didn't see the /dev/vdc getting detected, try rebooting the instance and check it again.</p>
<p>Now that the Volume is detected by the instance, you need to format it in able for you to use it.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Copy-Paste habit Warning!</b> /dev/vdc is just an example in here and it could vary, please replace it with proper name of the device in your case, to prevent accidentally formatting your other volumes!</p></blockquote>
<p>To format your device, execute</p>
<pre lang="bash">fdisk /dev/vdc
</pre>
<p>it will output something like this:</p>
<pre>root@webserver1:~# fdisk /dev/vdc

After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.

Command (m for help):
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Press n to create a new disk partition.</li>
<li>Press p to create a primary disk partition.</li>
<li>Press 1 to denote it as 1st disk partition.</li>
<li>Press ENTER twice to accept the default of 1st and last cylinder – to convert the remainder of hard disk to a single disk partition</li>
</ul>
<p>it should now look like this:</p>

<p>Now, the next thing to do is enter these commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press t, then select the new partition you made.</li>
<li>Press 83 change your new partition to 83, i.e. Linux partition type.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will take you back to this prompt:</p>

</pre>
<p>Logout in the SSH and reboot the instance by going to Projects &gt; Instances, select the checkbox next to your instance and click the "Soft Reboot Instances".</p>
<p>Now, login to SSH again as root.  Check if the system had mounted the filesystem by executing this command:</p>
<pre lang="bash">
mount
</pre>
<p>if you see some sort of  "/dev/vdc on" etc in the output, unmount it by </p>
<pre lang="bash">
umount -l /dev/vdc
</pre>
<p>Now, create the filesystem in the /dev/vdc1 partition by</p>
<pre lang="bash">
 mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc1
</pre>
<p>it should output something like</p>
<pre>
root@webserver1:~# mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdc1

</pre>
<p>Next is, you need to mount the volume to a directory. </p>
<p>Check the UUID of the volume by executing:</p>
<pre lang="bash">
blkid
</pre>
<p>it should multiple lines of output something like </p>
<p>/dev/vdc1: UUID="46218071-3b2f-4d9d-8eb3-61e313fa1325" TYPE="ext4"</p>
<p>the line with /dev/vdc1 is what we are interested with.</p>
<p>in this example, the 46218071-3b2f-4d9d-8eb3-61e313fa1325 is the UUID.</p>
<p>Now lets, say I want to mount the Volume in /data/www folder<br />
so that scripts and users can store/retrieve data in that path, i will need to create first that folder.</p>
<pre lang="bash">
mkdir /data
mkdir /data/www
</pre>
<p>Mount the volume to that directory using the volume UUID and the directory you just created</p>
<pre lang="bash">
mount /dev/disk/by-uuid/46218071-3b2f-4d9d-8eb3-61e313fa1325 /data/www
</pre>
<p>If you want your volume mount to persist after a reboot then you'll need to edit your fstab file to add the mount command:</p>
<p>edit the fstab file by</p>
<pre lang="bash">
nano /etc/fstab
</pre>
<p>Add the following line to the bottom of the file:</p>
<p>/dev/disk/by-uuid/46218071-3b2f-4d9d-8eb3-61e313fa1325 /data/www auto defaults,nofail 0 3</p>
<p>Save the file and Exit.</p>
<p>Verify if the Volume was attached properly by executing:</p>
<pre lang="bash">
df -h
</pre>
<p>you should see some sort of </p>
<pre>
Filesystem                                              Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
--------------- other lines in here ---------------
/dev/vdc1                                               9.9G  151M  9.2G   2% /data/www
</pre>
<p>if you see that, Congratulations! you had now attached a Volume in an instance!</p>
<p>You can now start saving and storing data in the /data/www folder, and whatever you store there will be stored in the Volume you just had created.</p>
<p>the main benefit of this is, even if your instance config gets messed up or something. You can just re-built a new instance and re-attach the volume.</p>
