    <blockquote>If you are not the customer, then you are the product being sold</p></blockquote>
<p>
When you are browsing a particular website, you might see an advertisement in the corner of the page, a Facebook Like button on the bottom of the post, a share button on the left or +1 icon of Google Plus and etc.<br />
Those things seems looks like an ordinary form of marketing or a new way of interaction that web developers adds on their web pages in able to "enhance"  the user experience.</p>
<p>But its rarely mentioned to us that in exchange of those things are some personal information that they are using to make some money. Take Facebook or Google for example, they allow you to use their services for "free". But then, how did they earn money in exchange of those?<br />
<!--more--><br />
So you are using social networks, various websites, blogs etc. but what they are getting from you is something not really private, but something that YOU should have control. Aside from the advertisement revenue they get when you view or click ads on their websites, they are also capturing your "online" behavior. </p>
<p>Online behavior relates to what kind of sites you visit often, how long you stay there, what is your country, what is your age, what food you prefer etc. Those information was being compiled by these "tracking" websites, so that they can sell it to advertisers and any other company that is interested to those data.</p>
<p>There is one <a href="https://www.abine.com/dntdetail.php">tool</a> that you can use to protect your online privacy, thus have a control on how your Internet activity is being tracked. It is called <a href="https://www.abine.com/dntdetail.php" target="_blank">"DoNotTrackMe"</a>.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/donottrackme.png"><img src="assets/donottrackme.png" alt="" title="donottrackme" width="439" height="594" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-723" /></a><br />
<br />
DoNotTrackMe is a browser extension (not a separate program) that you install in whatever browser you are using. When you got it installed in your browser, all the tracking activity of various websites will be automatically blocked by this extension. You can of course white list some websites that you trust so that they can still track you, but the thing is, you have a total control of what data is being collected from you.</p>
<p>Installing the browser extension is pretty easy, for Chrome, just go to Chrome Store, type in ""DoNotTrackMe" and there you go.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/donottrackme1.png"><img src="assets/donottrackme1.png" alt="" title="donottrackme1" width="923" height="299" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-724" /></a></p>
<p>Remember, by default, the extension will block "all" websites that is trying to track you. So unless you explicitly set it in the extension, you wont get tracked by any of those sites.</p>
