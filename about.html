<h3>Scaling existing applications</h3>


<p>I specialize in analyzing messy, slow and buggy codebase and turn them into a maintainable and scalable stuff. This include use of Containers via Docker, Load-balancing via HAProxy and ElasticSearch for enormous amount of data.</p>

<h3>Workflow Automation and Continous Integration</h3>

<p>From Git branching, tagging and build projects using Bamboo, anything can be properly checked for standards compliance. This includes ensuring Unit, Integration and Functional tests is actually done.</p>

<h3>Agile Project Management</h3>

<p>I regularly use JIRA Agile and Confluence. I love sprint planning and creating Product Requirements that is accurate down to the last story points.</p>
