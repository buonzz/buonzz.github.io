I'm not really a designer (but I know how to identify a good design vs not), so there is no cool flashy graphics or website thumbnails I could show you. However, I have worked and working with a lot of serious projects.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Operations Technical Support (DevOps)</h3>
<p>Perform troubleshooting, server setup optimization, code hot-fixing and post-mortem analysis of issues that occurs in production servers of members.teamskeet.com and the other 3rd party services on which it integrates into. Such as TMM NATS, NetBilling, Epoch, CCBill and SEGPAY. Using combination of Kibana, DataDog, NewRelic and Pingdom, audit trail and git commits in Gitlab, we need to define the root-cause analysis of why things are broken in production and how huge its impact is in the business.</p>

<h3>Laravel Best Practices</h3>
<p>previously the Laravel The Right Way site. It is a collection of curated best-practices for using Laravel Framework. I'ts a community of Laravel developers who would like to share their real-world experiences and industry-proven techniques in deploying Laravel applications</p>

<p>If you are trying to create a new PHP Composer library, whether it will be going to submitted to packagist.org or just in your Github account, this tool allows you to create a new one with ease by providing you a boilerplate code</p>

<h3>Server Migration of 100+ apps into new DataCenter</h3>
<p>Collaborating with our hosting provider Reflected.net, I'm responsible in creating migration plan by identifying which microservice and application should be moved first by analyzing each app dependency. Strategically aligning schedules and resources required in order to migrate the apps in new datacenter with least possible downtime and low impact to surfers.</p>

<h3>Custom Analytics and Tracking System Using ElasticSearch</h3>
<p>Built a Laravel Package that allows you to store Clicks, Impressions and Joins data into ElasticSearch Cluster, storing the data in different index per day, distributed into 3 shards. The data is then queried using Aggregrations, utilizing multiple shards (stored in 3 nodes). The design allows high throughput data ingestion as well as high reads in around ~500-900 million to in less than a second.</p>
