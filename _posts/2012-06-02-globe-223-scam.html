<p>Beware of having transaction with Western Union's "e-load" specially Globe network subscribers.</p>
<p>They are using a thing called ECPay which will send you a text message containing confusing instructions to claim your load</p>
<p>It will instruct you to dial 223<br />
which doesnt work at all<br />
it either will tell you<br />
"you dont have enough balance to make thi call"<br />
or<br />
"the call was not committed"</p>
<p>which will leave you ending up upset and confused</p>
<p>The truth is, the call card # and the pin number indicated are all just fake random numbers, they have no values at all</p>
<p>When you complain to the Western Union Branch, they will just tell you to call a customer help service - which as we know means talking to crappy persons behind the phone which doesnt really know what they are talking about</p>
<p>end of story- you've just lost your money, so share this link and save others</p>
