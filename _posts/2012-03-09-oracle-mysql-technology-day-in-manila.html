With Mr. Ivan Tu as presentor, I've got what I want when this taiwanese oracle guy whooped my ass chanting different updates and features beefed up with the MySQL Enterprise Products.</p>
<p>It is always being emphasized that "No, Oracle wont kill MySQL" even though convincing, seems they got no choice since the most popular database is already hooked up on most of the sites of the web (including this website) and he even said</p>
<p>"The only website that doesn't use MySQL is msn.com" - lol</p>
<p>Overall, its ok and fine, specially the price -- which is free. Even though this guy gave me a lot of problems understanding his english, I still managed to stay awake the whole event.</p>
<p>Here comes the most anticipated part:</p>
<p>The food Â and the freebies!</p>
<p>Ok, ok, the food is ok, a hotdog sandwich stuffed with lettuce - not really a fan of it, but had to swallow it since I dont want to go outside just for the food.</p>
<p>Slightly embarassed by the taste of the hotdog, they got me stunned when the Ivan stepped out of the platform and say his farewell. I had looked in my clock ( hey, its only 4:40, the seminar is up to 6:00)</p>
<p>whats comes next is an epic:</p>
<p>they played the movie John Carter!</p>
<p>and we live happily ever after</p>
