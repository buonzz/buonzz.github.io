<p>There is a famous saying:</p>

<blockquote>Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.</blockquote>

<p>Can be directly translated to its counterpart:</p>

<blockquote>PHP is what happens while you are busy learning other languages</blockquote>

<p>The quest for the ultimate programming language is a never ending process. People who want to do businesses doesn't actually gives a fuck if you are running the most hipster language of the year or not. What they do care is if your software does what they need and thats it. While you are busy learning the yet-another-hipster language, PHP-based scripts and tools is continously eating up the whole industry gaining stronger foothold.</p>

<h3>Business Interest &gt; Personal Interest</h3>
<h3>Profit - Expenses = Revenue</h3>
<h3>Carry a Toolbelt instead of a Hammer</h3>
<h3>Not every website requires military-grade security</h3>
<h3>Technical debt can be easily paid by rewriting the whole app</h3>
<h3>Realism</h3>
<h3>It is a good "niche"</h3>
<p>Advance developers tends to abandon PHP when they say learned Java Play, ExpressJS or RoR. That is natural, we learn better things and move to the next level. Ths in effect, causing a brain drain of "expert-level" developers in PHP community, opening a very high demand for expert-level PHP developers. </p>

<blockquote>Migration of competent level devs to other languages + the need for Senior-level PHP developers makes a good combination and opportunity for you to monetize your skills with very minimal resource input.</blockquote>
