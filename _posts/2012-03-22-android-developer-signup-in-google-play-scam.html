<p>Android Market which is now the Google Play is been on a very serious problems on processing the registration of new developers of Android,</p>
<p>First, the fact that they will collect you $25 one-time registration fee is where the story started.<br />
The problem arises due to the fact that Google is trying to lockout all Android devs to use Google Wallet as a mean of payment processing from registration down to app billing.</p>
<p>so now, you filled up the form, and ready to check out using the "Google Checkout" (a.k.a "scam")<br />
an email will be sent, saying your they start processing the order<br />
you will receive and email stating that your payment is cancelled, indicating there is no "charge" in your card<br />
you check your card "wtf, they charged me"<br />
now you ask for your refund.<br />
unfortunately -- you been a victim of a scam, and you have no way to retrieve the payment<br />
you ended up: Google Play account suspended, Google Wallet Suspended, Had your $25 money stolen</p>
<p>beware of this thing, the reason i see why google is locking Google wallet is because of this:</p>
<p>http://www.cbronline.com/news/security-hole-means-google-wallet-suspended-13.2.12</p>
<p>Google Wallet is compromised and they are locking it all out, Nice job Google, Apple is very happy about this<br />
because they will surely get a new set of developers coming along the way: all were frustrated of Google Play scam</p>
