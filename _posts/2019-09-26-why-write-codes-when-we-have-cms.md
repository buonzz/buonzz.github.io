This is a common question that people asks me when they heard about my job as being a Web Developer.  

For those uninitiated - it is very easy to publish websites nowadays through those tools mentioned in the title. So why hire a programmer and spend lot of money on developing a custom CMS if there is a tool for  that already exists?

<h3>You want to offer something unique - something that your competitors doesn’t have</h3>

If all websites is built using the same tool, the chances are they almost all look the same. For businesses where competition is tough, you need to differentiate to get noticed by your customers.

The easiest way to explain this is by making an analogy to something we can all relate: Food

If you translate the question into something like this, it will suddenly make sense:

<ul>
<li>Why we do need to cook food in our home, if there is McDonalds, Burger King, Wendys?</li>
<li>Why do Chefs keep creating new recipes, if they could just simply use the well-known recipes?</li>
<li>Why people keep eating trying out new restaurants, if they could simply cook at home?</li>
</ul>

WordPress, Wix and other products are like Fast foods - they could prepare your website really fast and convenient without knowledge of writing codes. But then you are stuck with what they offer.

As soon as you need to customize something, whether it is a design change or functionality - you’ll need someone who could make those customizations and more often than not - you’ll need a programmer to write those codes.
