<p>You might be wondering if there is any way on how to track whether someone already read your e-mail or not.<br />
Some use cases for this is:</p>
<p>- you sent some documents that needs to be read by someone before a specified time, and you want to make sure they read it before that time arrived<br />
- you want to make sure the e-mail you had sent is not in spam folder<br />
- confirm when someone keeps denying that they haven't read or received the e-mail<br />
- you want to trace where the exact location the e-mail was read by the receiver</p>
<p>To tell to you, yes, those are all possible.</p>
<p>What you need to make it possible are:<br />
- gmail e-mail account<br />
- firefox or chrome browser<br />
- RightInbox browser extension</p>
<p><script type="text/javascript"><!--<br />
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-0845730634111642";<br />
/* inline to posts */<br />
google_ad_slot = "8010460709";<br />
google_ad_width = 250;<br />
google_ad_height = 250;<br />
//--><br />
</script><br />
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"><br />
</script></p>
<p>Let me show you how it works,<br />
at first, you need to install the "RightInbox" browser extension from here -- <a href="http://www.rightinbox.com/install">http://www.rightinbox.com/install</a><br />
then, after installation,<br />
go to <a href="http://www.gmail.com">www.gmail.com</a><br />
a dialog will be confirming that the RightBox extension you had installed is now ready.<br />
It might ask some stuffs and authorization so that it can access your gmail account.</p>
<p>Now, click the "Compose" button on your gmail account,<br />
you should see 2 new buttons, like this<br />
<a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/right-inbox-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-191" title="right-inbox-2" alt="" src="assets/right-inbox-2.jpg" width="517" height="570" /></a></p>
<p>Check that "Track" button thing<br />
compose your email, then send it out.</p>
<p>Once the receiver had read/opened the email you sent,<br />
you will be receiving a message like this<br />
<a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/right-inbox-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-192" title="right-inbox-1" alt="" src="assets/right-inbox-1.png" width="480" height="434" /></a></p>
<p>As you could see, it details the ff.</p>
<p>- time and date when the user read the email<br />
- what IP and location did he read it</p>
<p>So now, you can confirm that the email you just sent was really read by the receiver!</p>
