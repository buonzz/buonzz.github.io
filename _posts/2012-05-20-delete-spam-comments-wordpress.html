<p>If you own or administers a blog, most likely you uses WordPress.<br />
One of the enemies of blogging softwares are spams - people and bots who puts a lot of trashy comments in your posts.</p>
<p>In such a case you forgot to install an anti-spam plugin, chances are you already got hundreds of thousands of comments pouring into your WordPress admin waiting for you to delete.</p>
<p>Thats was not a very and nice task to do - delete or mark each of those comments</p>
<p>The best and fastest solution to this is by deleting the unapproved comments directly via your database</p>
<p>You need to have an access to your database in order to do this (phpmyadmin or ssh)</p>
<p>then execute this: DELETE from wp_comments WHERE comment_approved = '0'; </p>
<p>then there you go, problem solved!</p>
