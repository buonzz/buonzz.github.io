<p>GPS personal tracker is great to have for variety of reasons, in my case, there are several use-cases I need it:
<ul>
<li>During long travels, I often lose track of the roads and routes the vehicle I'm riding went into (when you fell asleep for example ), I would like to log those routes in a simple text file, so I can review it later in a map. This information can be used when let's say you have to go to the same place later and you are driving yourself the car.
</li>
<li>It's a safety mechanism in case I lost my 3-year old in a crowd when we go outside. A GPS tracker installed in his bag ensures I can find him no matter what.</li>
<li>Track movement, vibrations and geo-fence of my Car and Bike (yeah, the GPS device will send you a text message when any of those is triggered)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>I ordered the <a href="http://www.lazada.com.ph/gps-personal-tracker-with-internal-memory-slot-245394.html" target="_blank">product</a> in Lazada website on May 8th. The estimated delivery date ( COD ) is around May 16-18. The item is fulfilled by this site called https://www.latestgadget.com.ph/ . The cost was about PHP 2,499 (around $54). It is not cheap, its not so expensive either.

<p>One weird thing about Lazada's website is, their Order tracking page doesn't gives the tracking number of the courier. I have to check it in my email and the tracking code is there.</p>

<p>I saw in my email the tracking code around May 10. The courier is Air21. Sigh!, they are terrible one compared to LBC, they don't have a decent office in our town and their delivery agents usually is having hard time finding someone-else home, the last product they is shipped by Air 21 ended up shipped back to Manila, because they cannot find my home.</p>

<p>I have to actually go to the distribution center itself to pick up the package and pay it there. To make sure it wont be going anywhere this time.</p>

<h3>Unboxing</h3>

<p>

The first impression you will have upon seeing the GPS tracket itself -- it is small. Which makes sense, since like for example if you want to do some covert operation and slip this tracker into someone else's bag, It is really easy since it is very light and not bulky.
</p>

<p><img src="/img/gps/IMG_1074.JPG" style="float:right;margin:10px;"/>Mine came with 2 set of batteries, as well as two back covers (not sure why, is those parts always getting misplaced by previous customers?) It also have this manual which contains all the commands needed in able to interact with this device.</p>

<p>The device looks like a super basic phone that has no screen on it, just 2 buttons, 1  LED display, small mic opening, mini USB port and the rest looks like a typical candy-bar setup.
MicroSD and SIM card is a bit difficult to install, since MicroSD is tucked right below the SIM card. So in case you need to get the MicroSD, you'll need to open the case, remove the battery, remove the SIM card and finally get the MicroSD (brilliant setup).
</p>

<p><img style="float:right;margin:10px;" src="/img/gps/IMG_1069.JPG" /> For the SIM card, I'm using Smart (http://smart.com.ph/) since it is the spare one that I've got. Ideally, You might need to have both numbers share the same Telco provider to prevent more expensive SMS rates. It worked pretty well in my case, I'm able to call the unit and receive locations to my phone.</p>

* Sim Card and MicroSD card is not easily installable
* green blinking text turns on right away as soon as you plug the battery
* 2,499.00 (around $54) - not cheap.
* feels like a small cellphone (without screen), identical like batteries, simcard and sd card placement
* the handle like thing is its gps antenna
