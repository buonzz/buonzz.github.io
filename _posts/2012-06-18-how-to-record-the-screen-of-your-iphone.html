<p>Originally, Apple doesn't allow any application to record/capture the screen of iPhone or any iOS device. The only allowed one is screen capture, or snapshot of your screen (which can be done by holding the home button then pressing the power button once)</p>
<p>But, the problem with screencap is it was just an image. Sometimes, we want to demonstrate how we do something in our phone that is hard to show via images (playing a game for example)</p>
<p>You might hear that via jail-breaking, that is possible.<br />
But the problem with jail-breaking is it is not really supported by Apple itself<br />
and sometimes not worth it considering the amount of risk it posed to your device</p>
<p>Now, App Store allowed an app that simply do the same job, legally, w/o violating any rules<br />
it is called <strong>Display Recorder</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-19_02h55_43.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-322" title="2012-06-19_02h55_43" src="assets/2012-06-19_02h55_43-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>it can be bought at App Store <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/display-recorder/id520411468?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4">here</a></p>
<p>you can view my sample recording in this page<br />

<p>So far, it works on simple applications<br />
it slightly slows down the phone specially if you are recording a game which graphics intensive</p>
<p>but overall, it does the job</p>
