<p>Manny Pacquiao and Juan Manuel Marquez will clash again in Dec 8,2012. The rivalry between these two great boxers will hopefully end with this fight.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/pacquiao_marquez_4_poster_medium.jpg"><img src="assets/pacquiao_marquez_4_poster_medium.jpg" alt="" title="pacquiao_marquez_4_poster_medium" width="455" height="672" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-552" /></a></p>
<p>So far, the scores are 2 wins for Pacquiao and one draw. Though all the three fights are subject to dispute, we must admit, official wins will be always the one considered. Like how Pacquiao had lost to Bradley last time, it will be always Bradley who will be considered as winner no matter what opinion you might have in your mind. Winners writes the history not losers.</p>
<p>But what seems the most intriguing question is: We used to see Pacquiao beating great boxers, why cant he beat Marquez?</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Well, the answer is not straightforward but can be simplified by saying  "styles makes fights"<br />
Marquez's style is perfectly designed to negate Pacquiao's style. While Pacquiao's style is not designed to beat Marquez's style.</p>
<p>Then if its about the fighting styles, what are the styles of both boxers that makes these thing happens?</p>
<p>Marquez's style is "Counter-puncher". Primary objective of that style is to wait for the opponent to strike, then strike back. It is more of studying the opponents strategy and formulate a counter attack bases on that. The problem with this style is, it is too hard to win a knockout if you are backing up most of the time and just waits for an attack. You need an aggressive opponent for you to succeed if this is your game-play, or else the fight will end up boring to watch for casual viewers since its rarely knockdowns will happen with this kind of fight. This is very technical type of fight that is not so attractive to watch for those who doesn't know the technicalities of boxing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Pacquiao's style, being a slugger, his style is to always attack. This style's main objective is to overpower or knock out an opponent at the most earliest possible time. This is a style on which the boxer is aggressive and always moves forward no matter what. To be able to do this, one requires power, speed and stamina to overpower the opponent. The problem is, this kind of style is very susceptible to counter-attack. Though being less technical in strategy, this type of fighting is very attractive to watch for global public. This is maybe due to the fact that most of the fights using this strategy results in knockouts and knockdowns which is highly anticipated by global public.</p>
<p>This scenario is not specific to Pacquiao and Marquez, this will always happen whenever a slugger and a counterpuncher met. Some might consider Marquez as the winner on all fights, but sluggers being aggressive will always gets the victory since commonly, the one who moves forward are the one favored by the judges.</p>
<p>Even though Marquez might had bested Pacquiao in some area of boxing skills, judging by how Marquez tried to beat Pacquiao is not still convincingly absolute. Why? first of all, he was knocked down by this guy many times, while him, not even once. The only victory that Marquez can tell is the "public opinion" about some 2-7 points margin in the scorecards on each fight which is not even officially agreed upon by judges. You cant beat someone with just points, you need to knock down at least once, or lets say, get those margin of points extremely large, which is seems didnt happened as well. </p>
<p>For sure, Marquez deserves better than Bradley's win over Pacquiao, but unfortunately Marquez still need to be more aggressive.</p>
