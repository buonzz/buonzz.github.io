<p>Ok, I get it. Two person goes into this page : either a desperate HR who looks for a Laravel Developer or a starving Laravel Developer who needs some project to work at in exchange of some money.</p>
<p>Don't worry, I got your back. You can go in this site <a href="http://withlaravel.com/" target="_blank">WithLaravel.com</a></p>
<p>That site contains two things</p>
<p>Laravel Project and Positions - <a href="http://withlaravel.com/projects" target="_blank">http://withlaravel.com/projects</a> which is a list of things of projects and positions that a Laravel Developer can apply. If you are a HR, post your ads in there as well.</p>
<p>Laravel Developers - <a href="http://withlaravel.com/developers" target="_blank">http://withlaravel.com/developers</a>. This is where developers can post their name and website (in case you wanted to get a job). For HR guys, pick devs in there.</p>
<p>UPDATE Aug 12, 2014:  LaraJobs is also a great source of hiring Laravel Develoeprs <a href="http://packalyst.com/partner/larajobs" target="_blank">http://packalyst.com/partner/larajobs</a></p>
<p>You might be expecting that I would say in here, "go to the facebook group page and post your ads in there".<br />
I bet you, most of the guys in the facebook group page is either busy with their own projects. If you go straight to that site, you are sure those positions are opened and those devs is available for work, since nobody would post their profile there if they are not looking for work (duh).</p>
