<p>Let me show you some example first to better illustrate and put some context. Let us start with the most popular of them all -- Linux Torvalds (father of Linux ). One of the few remarkable ones are:
</p>

<h3>Linux Pull Request Meltdown</h3>

<p>On this <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/11/02/linux-creator-linus-torvalds-had-a-meltdown-over-a-pull-request-and-it-was-awesome/#gref" target="_blank">post</a> you can see more details about the incident, wherein a contributor had submitted a pull request for some changes and unfortunately Linus find the changes not satisfying, this had caused him to utter words such as crap,shit and idiot.</p>

<h3>Nvidia Fuck You!</h3>
<p>Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVpOyKCNZYw" target="blank">video</a> to see how Linus pulled out his middle finger during a public conference, facing the camera straight and saying "Nvidia Fuck You!"</p>

<h3>Java is a horrible language</h3>

<p>An <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa55RKWZxxI" target="_blank">interview</a> with Linus by some fella turned into some ranting about Java.</p>

<p>Aside from those, there are other less-popular grumpiness we encouter in daily basis:</p>

<h3>Social Media and Public Forums</h3>
<p>There are lots of thread out there on which simply asking some question will quickly retaliated with :
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lmgtfy.com/">"Let me Google that for you" link</a></li>
<li> ironic/troll answers making the poster feel they had asked very stupid question.</li>
<li>"dont ask us to do your homework"</li>
<li>"maybe we should protect this thread from noobs" statements</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>There are actually some popular Twitter account specially crafted to just mock "Clueless Managers" asking some stupid questions/statements</p>
<p>Few notable Tweets are:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Can we get a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DevOps?src=hash">#DevOps</a>? I have no idea what it is, but I keep hearing people talk about it. How much is a devop anyway?</p>&mdash; Clueless Dev Manager (@clueless_dev) <a href="https://twitter.com/clueless_dev/status/605104791434326016">May 31, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
The tweet seems implies the Manager is too stupid to not know that DevOps is not something you can just walk in to store to buy some of it.
</p> 

<p>while this seems fun to read for some developers, people outside our profession doesn't find it funny.</p>


<h3>IT/MIS Department/Technical support</h3>
<p>Corporate/private organizations is not safe as well for those grumpiness from developers, specially on Manager-Developers relations and System Administrators-End Users conversations. This might come in many forms and usually not mean as you can find in public internet group/forums, but to some extent still annoying because of the way how sarcastic and "unfriendly" the approach the conversation is being carried out.</p>

<h1>So why this is happening?</h1>

<p>answer varies from different factors, but I could illustrate some key points that might be applicable in some cases in one way or another.</p>

<h2>Medium of Communication</h2>
<p>There is this popular phrase in this <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/25/132" target="_blank">mail</a></p>

<blockquote>Talk is cheap. Show me the code.</blockquote>

<p>Unlike ordinary humans, wherein we use all sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_communication" target="_blank">Interpersonal communications</a>. Developers tend to think that written program code is the most effective way to communicate.This lead into making less verbally active developers, since they rather "showcase" their idea/thoughts via code rather than telling it by himself.</p>

<p>To understand the reason behind that thinking, imagine if you are a director of a movie and you are showing it to your friends. You rather shut your mouth and let your friends see the good things about your work with their own eyes, instead of you telling them one by one what are the good things about the movie.</p>
