<p>Let me show you some example first to better illustrate and put some context. Let us start with the most grumpiest of them all -- Linux Torvalds (father of Linux ). One of the few remarkable ones are

<h3>Linux Pull Request Meltdown</h3>

<p>This <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/11/02/linux-creator-linus-torvalds-had-a-meltdown-over-a-pull-request-and-it-was-awesome/#gref" target="_blank">post</a> you can see more details about the incident, wherein a contributor had submitted a pull request for some changes and unfortunately Linus find the changes not satisfying, this had caused him to utter words such as crap,shit and idiot.</p>

<h3>Nvidia Fuck You!</h3>
<p>Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVpOyKCNZYw" target="blank">video</a> to see how Linus pulled out his middle finger during a public conference, facing the camera straight and saying "Nvidia Fuck You!"</p>

<p>There are actually some popular Twitter account specially crafted to just mock "Clueless Managers" asking some stupid questions/statements</p>
<p>Few notable Tweets are:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Can we get a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DevOps?src=hash">#DevOps</a>? I have no idea what it is, but I keep hearing people talk about it. How much is a devop anyway?</p>&mdash; Clueless Dev Manager (@clueless_dev) <a href="https://twitter.com/clueless_dev/status/605104791434326016">May 31, 2015</a></blockquote>

<h3>IT/MIS Department Technical support</h3>
