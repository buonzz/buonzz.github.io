<p>If you are a person who believes that the gadget of IronMan on his suit is just fiction -- you get it wrong<br />

Google's recent project called "Project Glass" aims to bring augmented reality to our daily lives.</p>
<p><i>"Augmented reality is a live, direct or indirect, view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated sensory input such as sound,video, graphics or GPS data."</i></p>
<p>In layman's word -- its the thing you see in most movies where the real physical world is there, where you can click the buttons and stuffs right on the glass in front of you and it seems reacts and respond to what the physical world is.</p>

<p>Like for example, you see someone, the computer on your eyeglasses can analyze the distance to that person and display the profile of that person right in your eyeglasses.</p>
<p>Commonly, we see this technology in military and computer games, where for example in head up displays<br />

<p>Wherein you see the enemy in your front, then 2 circles are trying to lock the target on that plane, things like that.</p>
<p>Well, anyway, of course the application to our daily lives is not like that, it would be more of things like browsing internet, locating your current position, logging and analyzing data at real-time etc.</p>
<p>In relation to this, Google co-founder Sergey Brin ( on the left ) is been spotted to wear some weird eyeglasses which is serves as the prototype of that augmented reality technology<br />

<p>Whether this technology is a stunt or just a fiction, clearly this is a giant leap again in consumer electronics</p>
<p>touchscreen devices aren't the latest and coolest technology anymore!<br />
