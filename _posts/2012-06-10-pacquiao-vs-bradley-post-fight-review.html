<p>I dont need to tell the details of the fight.<br />
But it is very evident that everyone was shocked- even bradley itself was shocked on how did he won</p>
<p>Well, to visualize it in a wider range, look at these thoughts:</p>
<p>1. Pacquiao needs to regain the sympathy of the public due to his last fight with marquez</p>
<p>2. Bob Arum needs to protect his money: if manny retired on boxing, there should be someone which should takes pac's position as his money magnet - in this case, it is bradley</p>
<p>3. Avoidance of Mayweather bout. Aside from mayweather, there is no other big fight manny could do. No more big fights means, no more money, bob didnt want that</p>
<p>4. If pacquiao won, again, there will be no other opponent,so in able to gain a rematch, pac should lose. so that there is a rematch, rematch means more money</p>
<p>5. pac indeed is on its downward slope of career, but based on the performance he gave with bradley, seems that is not the case, he clearly pulverized the guy</p>
<p>6. the true loser to this fight was marquez - he was working in his entire career to beat pacquiao, but was denied for it. bradley didnt deserves that victory, marquez does</p>
<p>Again, I hate people who says , "it is scripted", "it was robbery" etc</p>
<p>well, since when you guys lived?<br />
boxing is more of gambling than sports,  whatever will generate money, thats what will prevail - everything in vegas, even the whole U.S., that how things works</p>
