# Politics Was Never Meant to Be a Career

In modern times, politics has become a profession in itself. Many politicians spend their entire adult lives campaigning, building alliances, and staying in office. But that was never how politics was supposed to work.

## The Original Idea: Civic Duty, Not Career

In its ideal form, politics was meant to be a **temporary act of public service**. Individuals from various walks of life—successful business owners, lawyers, soldiers, police officers, teachers, and other professionals—would step away from their daily roles to serve in government. They would bring their **real-world experience**, **industry knowledge**, and **moral integrity** into the legislative process.

After a term or two, they would step down and return to their original professions. This ensured that policymakers stayed grounded in the realities of the people they represented.

## The Rise of the Professional Politician

Today, many politicians have no substantial experience outside of politics. They begin their careers as aides or campaign staffers, climb the ladder through party politics, and spend decades in office. Their primary skill set revolves around:

- Crafting a public image  
- Navigating party dynamics  
- Appealing to donors  
- Managing media narratives  
- Winning elections  

While these skills might help them stay in power, they don't necessarily translate into **effective governance**. Too often, policies are shaped more by political calculation than by practical understanding.

## Why This Is a Problem

When politics becomes a lifelong career, the incentive structure shifts. Instead of focusing on long-term national or community well-being, career politicians may focus on:

- Short-term popularity  
- Lobbyist interests  
- Party loyalty over public service  
- Avoiding controversy at the cost of necessary change  

This can lead to **stagnation**, **corruption**, and a growing disconnect between leaders and citizens.

## What Should Change

We need to reframe political service as **a form of civic duty**—not a career path. This might look like:

- Encouraging professionals to run for office and serve temporarily  
- Term limits to prevent power hoarding  
- Electoral systems that reward competence and integrity, not just charisma  
- A culture that respects stepping in and out of politics, instead of clinging to office  

## In Conclusion

Politics should be **an extension of real life**, not a separate class of careerists. When leaders come from the same industries, communities, and experiences as the people they represent, decisions are more grounded, honest, and effective.

It's time to stop rewarding those who specialize in being politicians—and start encouraging those who specialize in living, building, protecting, and serving society to lead for a season, and then return.
