<p>Powered with <strong>VxWorks Operating System</strong>, programmed using Java and C++  . Curiosity Rover is by far one of the most ambitious attempt of humankind to explore Mars.</p>
<p>The CPU used for this  was <strong>PowerPC 750</strong> processors operating at 200MHz with 2GB of flash memory storage.  ( same CPU used by Apple Computers)</p>
<p>Curiosity Rover was expected to land in Mars around August 6 to 7 2012, to explore Mars for any sign of life.</p>
<p>The distance between Earth and Mars is 154 million miles which this robot needs to travel in able to start its mission and bringing new knowledge to humans here on earth</p>

<p>The place in Mars called Gale Crater, is the primary location of the said mission and the primary objective is exploring the Aeolis Mons. It is a huge sedimentary rock which is believed to have some important data about the history of Mars.</p>
<p>Using the samples in said sedimentary rock, the scientist will be able to confirm, if there is ever any form of life that exists in Mars, millions years ago up to present.</p>
<p>Unlike other robots, Curiosity is not using Solar energy (energy from the sun). Instead, it is a nuclear-powered. Specifically,  by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, using the heat produced by the decay of radioactive plutonium dioxide to generate electricity.</p>
<p>Thus, this robot is enormously powerful and can last up to 2 years in Mars exploring and analyzing things.</p>
<p>This is by far, another giant leaf for mankind in case this guy will find anything in Mars.</p>
