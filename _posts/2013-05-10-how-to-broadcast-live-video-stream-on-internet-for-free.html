<p>Are you currently shooting a live video that you want other people to see in real-time?<br />
Whether you are attending some festivities or party that you want to publish on Internet at real time or you are a celebrity singer who has legions of fans waiting for you to sing in front of your computer, there is no other easy way to do that aside from live streaming via Internet.</p>
<p>Of course you can do Skype, Facetime of Google Hangout to do some video-conference. But that is more of private within a particular group of people. When you say "broadcasting", you are publishing your video to the whole general public, most often, you don't care who is viewing online, probably hundreds or even million viewers around the world.</p>
<p>For this purpose, there are two prominent free web-based services to assist you.</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://twitcam.livestream.com/" target="_blank">Twitcam</a><br />
This tool requires no software to be installed in your computer, all you need to have is a working webcam and that's it. You also need an active Twitter account, you can chat with your followers while they are viewing you online.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/" target="_blank">UStream</a><br />
This is another great tool for more serious type of broadcasting. It has a pro version which offers more advanced way of streaming video online.</p>
<p>Try those out and let me know what you think! :-)</p>
