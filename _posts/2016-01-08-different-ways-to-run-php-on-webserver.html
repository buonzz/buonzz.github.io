<p>For developers, there is not much difference whatever PHP handler is executing their application in the web server. It simply works!. But for System Administrator view, there are wide array of options to choose from. Depending on the nature of the site, you migth pick one over the other. Here is my opinionated view of what I think is the different strength and weakness of each PHP handlers:</p>
