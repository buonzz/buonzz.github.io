<p>We are used to presentations where there are slides that you can hit the next/previous button to show the slides. These one dimensional presentations though lacks the ability to "drill-down" to complex concepts that needs to be presented on hierarchical manner.</p>
<p>Other presentations as well lacks the ability to be able to share easily, one for example needs to have Microsoft Powerpoint installed in his computer to view the presentation. Though there are web-based services like SlideShare for web-based presentations,  this is still a one-dimensional way of presenting contents.</p>
<p><a href="http://prezi.com/recommend/fny6a3qncdlr/" target="_blank">Prezi</a> on the other hand is a revolutionary way of presenting contents online. It is also accessible in mobile devices. Unlike the traditional way of presenting contents, this allows the user to "pan and zoom" on the contents.</p>
<p>The presentation below will be a good demo, try it out:</p>

<p>So... what do you think? cool huh?</p>
<p>Go on, explore it more in <a href="http://prezi.com/recommend/fny6a3qncdlr/" target="_blank">Prezi.com</a> site and let me know! :-)</p>
