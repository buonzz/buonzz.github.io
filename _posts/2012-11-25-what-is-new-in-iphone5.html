<h4><strong>Faster Processor</strong></h4>
<p>A faster processor means more powerful phone. The A6 processor compared to A5(used by iPhone 4S) and A4 (used by iPhone 4) is a lot faster with the blazing speed of 1.3 GHz with a dual-core CPU. The previous one which is A5 is only about 800 Mhz (iPhone4s) to 1 Ghz (iPad 2) which is a big difference. The SDRAM is is also a lot faster since iPhone 5 has<br />
1GB of LPDDR2 SDRAM compared to iPhone4s which had only 512MB of LPDDR2 SDRAM.<br />

<h4><strong>4G LTE capable</strong></h4>
<p>4G LTE means a faster network connection, with this technology, mobile users will gonna have faster Internet access. Although it means that your carrier should also provide a 4G signal in able for you to utilize this technology. So there is no real use, if your country doesn't have 4G available yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Larger Screen</strong></h4>
<p>iPhone 5 has 4-inch (diagonal) Retina display with a resolution of 1136x640. While the iPhone 4 and iPhone4s has only 3.5-inch (diagonal) Retina display with a 960-by-640 resolution. That means the display of iPhone 5 is sharper and can display more information without pixelating.</p>

<h4><strong>Sim Card</strong></h4>
<p>Yes, you have to change your phone number if you want to use an iPhone 5. Existing SIM card is not compatible with iPhone 5. It is using a "nano-SIM", while the iPhone 4, iPhone 4s and iPad is using "micro-sim". Nano-SIM is a lot smaller than micro-sim. The regular SIM size that we used to know can be cut to have a micro-sim, but unfortunately, regular sim card cannot be cut for you to convert it to a nano-sim. So you have to buy a new sim card if you will use an iPhone 5.</p>

<h4><strong>Front Camera</strong></h4>
<p>On iPhone 4 and 4s, the front camera is just VGA camera. iPhone 5 now uses 1.2 Megapixel camera on the front, featuring a 720p (HD) video recording capability.</p>

<h4><strong>Charger / Connector</strong></h4>
<p>The connector was trimmed down from 30-pin to 8-pin connector, called "Lightning". There is no real improvement in speed but just a mere reduction of space occupied by the connector itself. That would mean, you cannot reuse the charger/ connector you have for previous iPod Touch/ iPhone 4 (although there is an adapter that you can buy).</p>

<h4><strong>New Design</strong></h4>
<p>iPhone 3GS and lower has a shiny metal plate on its back, then on iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S, they have a glass back which makes it seems very fragile. On iPhone 5, the aluminum metal was brought back but not with a shiny one, but with an anodized aluminum, although the top and bottom part remains a glass.</p>
