<p>The storm is likely "the strongest one since December 2006," NOAA scientist Joseph Kunches said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>If you do still remember one of the highlights of the movie 2012, there is a scenario where the leading man got a call from a indian national saying he found something strange happening in the core of the earth which is caused by some solar flare.<br />
Here is a storyline from the 2012 movie:</p>
<p><i>Dr. Adrian Helmsley, part of a worldwide geophysical team investigating the effect on the earth of radiation from unprecedented solar storms, learns that the earth's core is heating up. He warns U.S. President Thomas Wilson that the crust of the earth is becoming unstable and that without proper preparations for saving a fraction of the world's population, the entire race is doomed. Meanwhile, writer Jackson Curtis stumbles on the same information. While the world's leaders race to build "arks" to escape the impending cataclysm, Curtis struggles to find a way to save his family. Meanwhile, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes of unprecedented strength wreak havoc around the world. </i></p>
<p>wtf!</p>
