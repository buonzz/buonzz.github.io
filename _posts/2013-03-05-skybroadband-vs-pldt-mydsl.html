<p>If you are looking forward to get an Internet connection in the Philippines, most likely you'll hear these two major competing Internet service providers. I will going to give you a quick breakdown for each, as I had experienced subscribing in those both service.<br />
<!--more--><br />
<strong>PLDT</strong><br />
Pros</p>
<ol>
<li>quick in response to customer support.</li>
<li>multiple ways to contact support: landline, public pldt phone (free) and email</li>
<li>convenientÂ payment system</li>
<li>comes with a landline phone</li>
</ol>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ol>
<li>connection slows down and gets crappy after 4-6 months</li>
<li>router is always getting disconnected</li>
<li>when you have your subscription disconnected, reconnecting fee is PHP 800</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SkyBroadband</strong><br />
Pros:</p>
<ol>
<li>cheaper price</li>
<li>has a 1 month trial option</li>
<li>router always gets online</li>
</ol>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ol>
<li>connection quality is low, its either slow or very choppy</li>
<li>uses proxy server which makes hard to connect to websites outside the country</li>
<li>hidden payments</li>
<li>connection quality becomes crappy right after you had subscribed</li>
<li>speedtest results is ok, but because of their forced use of proxy server, the connection is extremely slow</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are going to see the pattern, yeah, its seems common to ISP to degrade the quality of service after several months of usage. This is one of the things I truly hate with ISP. For now, I cant see any single ISP in Philippines that is really reliable without emptying your pocket.</p>
