# Logitech G203 Lightsync Mouse Too Slow on Mac? (G Hub Stuck Loading Fix Inside)

If your **Logitech mouse feels too slow on macOS**, or if **Logitech G Hub keeps freezing on the loading screen**, you’re not alone.  
This post covers exactly what happened to me with the **Logitech G203 Lightsync** — how I wasted hours troubleshooting G Hub on my **Mac**, and how the ultimate fix turned out to be a *tiny button behind the scroll wheel*.

## When a Simple Mouse Feels Broken

I bought the Logitech G203 Lightsync thinking it was a serious upgrade — precise, fast, “gaming-grade.”  
I don’t even play games; I just wanted better performance for everyday use on macOS.

But when I plugged it in, the cursor felt *painfully slow*.  
No matter how high I set the **tracking speed** in macOS settings, it barely moved faster.  
So I assumed: maybe Logitech requires their fancy driver software to make this work properly.

That’s where the nightmare began.

## Logitech G Hub Stuck on Loading Screen (macOS)

To unlock “advanced features,” Logitech tells you to install **G Hub**.  
Here’s what actually happens on macOS:

- The G Hub **freezes on the loading screen** more often than it opens.  
- When it does open, it **steals focus** from other apps — you can be typing in Safari or Notes, and G Hub suddenly pops up in front.  
- Even after logging in, it’s **laggy, unreliable**, and occasionally hangs during startup.

At one point, I spent half an hour watching the “Loading” spinner — just to realize my mouse was still crawling at snail speed.

## I Tried Everything (Don’t Bother)

I went through every “fix” forum users suggested:

- Deleting and reinstalling G Hub.  
- Right-clicking the app, showing package contents, and tweaking the internal files.  
- Installing third-party apps like SteerMouse or USB Overdrive (which either didn’t open or didn’t help).  

Nothing worked.  
The mouse still felt like dragging through mud.

## The Real Fix: Press the DPI Button

Here’s the part Logitech never makes obvious:  
There’s a **tiny button right behind the scroll wheel** — that’s the **DPI switch**.

Press it a few times while moving your mouse.  
Each press changes the sensitivity (DPI).  
You’ll instantly feel the speed difference.

That’s it.  
You don’t need G Hub.  
You don’t need to modify system files.  
Just press that button until your cursor feels normal.

## Does It Remember After Reboot?

Yes — the G203 Lightsync **remembers your last DPI setting** even after you unplug it or restart your Mac.  
The only way it resets is if you hold that DPI button while plugging it in (which performs a factory reset).

So once you find your perfect sensitivity, you’re done for good.

---

## Why the Colors Keep Changing

The G203’s color cycling has nothing to do with DPI or performance.  
That’s just its built-in “Lightsync RGB” effect.  
It’ll keep changing colors unless you disable it using G Hub on a Windows PC (the setting will stick afterward).  
Otherwise, ignore the rainbow light show — it’s purely cosmetic.

## Final Thoughts: Don’t Install Logitech G Hub on macOS

If you’re using macOS and your **Logitech mouse feels too slow**, here’s the TL;DR:

> ❌ Don’t install Logitech G Hub.  
> ✅ Just press the DPI button behind the scroll wheel.

That’s all you need.  

G Hub is bloated, buggy, and unnecessary for simple DPI adjustments.  
It often causes more problems than it solves, especially on macOS where driver support is shaky at best.
