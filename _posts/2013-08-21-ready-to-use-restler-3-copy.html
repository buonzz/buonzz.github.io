<p>Being a fan of CodeIgniter wherein you will just simply download a zip file and extract it into a folder. One of things I don't like with Laravel and Restler is you have to do all this crazy stuffs of:</p>
<p>1. install composer<br />
2. install git<br />
3. download phar file<br />
4. enable openssl and other bs extensions<br />
etc.</p>
<p>this is just way too much hassle instead of just giving the whole zip file for use.<br />
I know this is because of dependency and stuffs, but nobody has really enough time to worry about those when you are in the middle of talking to clients.</p>
<p>So here it is, I just had generated the files in a standard way on how the official <a href="http://restler3.luracast.com/index.html#installation" target="_blank">guide</a> explains it and put it in a zip file for reuse.</p>
<p>Click on the Google Drive link below to access the zip file</p>

<p>Happy Restling!</p>
