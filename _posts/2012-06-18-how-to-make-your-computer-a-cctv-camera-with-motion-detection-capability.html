<p>You might be amazed of cctv cameras used in secured places, train stations and etc.</p>
<p>Today, I will teach you how to setup one in your own home, with the gadgets you already have and without buying those expensive gadgets we see in full blown surveillance camera.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-18_13h28_22.png"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-317" title="2012-06-18_13h28_22" alt="" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-06-18_13h28_22-150x150.png" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>You can use this tips to:</p>
<ul>
<li>monitor your house for any activity</li>
<li>view the live video via your mobile phone (real-time ) of what your computer/laptop is seeing currently when you are away (even if you are in another country)</li>
<li>store snapshots of any motion detected by your camera in the disk for future review</li>
</ul>
<p>To start with, let us enumerate what you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>computer/laptop/netbook with camera</li>
<li>any Android/iOS device (iPad, iPod, iPhone, Galaxy Y, Samsung Android Phones etc.)</li>
<li>DropBox Account <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">https://www.dropbox.com/</a> - make sure you install it in your computer</li>
</ul>
<p>So first, download the iCam software <a href="http://skjm.com/icam/support.php">here</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-18_13h21_56.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-313" title="2012-06-18_13h21_56" alt="" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-06-18_13h21_56-300x203.png" width="300" height="203" /></a></p>
<p>install it in your computer</p>
<p><a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-18_13h25_14.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-314" title="2012-06-18_13h25_14" alt="" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-06-18_13h25_14.png" width="272" height="229" /></a></p>
<p>it should display a lens icon and should be setup to auto-start when you boot your computer . Also, make sure you have Dropbox installed both in your mobile phone and pc<br />
<script type="text/javascript"><!--<br />
google_ad_client = "ca-pub-0845730634111642";<br />
/* inline to posts */<br />
google_ad_slot = "8010460709";<br />
google_ad_width = 250;<br />
google_ad_height = 250;<br />
//--><br />
</script><br />
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"><br />
</script></p>
<p>Now click the iCam icon. you should see something like this</p>
<p><a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-18_13h27_29.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-316" title="2012-06-18_13h27_29" alt="" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-06-18_13h27_29-274x300.png" width="274" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>In the camera tab, set a username and password to the bottom of the dialog</p>
<p>make sure also that the Auto-Start checkbox is checked</p>
<p>That image in that camera tab is the one that will be recorded once you set-up the system, so make sure to put the camera in a viewpoint that you are interested in monitoring with .</p>
<p>So the camera is now setup in your pc, now you need to setup your phone, so that you can access via your phone the video that your pc is seeing.</p>
<p>Depending on your phone (Android or iOS). Download the iCam app and install it in your mobile phone</p>
<p>Start the application in your phone and enter the username/password you entered in your pc earlier</p>
<p><a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0219.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-318" title="IMG_0219" alt="" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/IMG_0219-300x200.png" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>Right now, I'm viewing my pc camera via my phone (you can have up to 4 camera setup)</p>
<p>Now, the issue is, depending on the cellphone signal, the video might be choppy.And, you dont want to stare at your camera when there is nothing to watch - no one is moving</p>
<p>So here we go, we will set it up, so that the camera is only active when there is "motion" detected by your camera.</p>
<p>Now, click the Motion Detection tab</p>
<p><a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-18_13h28_22.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-317" title="2012-06-18_13h28_22" alt="" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-06-18_13h28_22-300x221.png" width="300" height="221" /></a></p>
<p>you will see the camera with crossed-lines</p>
<p>each square in the image means an area that can be separately monitored for motions</p>
<p>right now, the iCam software was already detecting any motions seens by your camera, and a snapshot of that image is stored in your hard-disk</p>
<p>the trick is here -- to have your mobile phone have an access to the images captured by the iCam software, make the folder location where it saves images under your dropbox folder</p>
<p><a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2012-06-18_13h26_51.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-315" title="2012-06-18_13h26_51" alt="" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/2012-06-18_13h26_51-300x159.png" width="300" height="159" /></a></p>
<p>so that, when you want to view what is happening in your house (or any other place you have your pc/laptop camera is), all you need to do is open your dropbox app in your mobile phone</p>
<p>And that is that,</p>
<p>you have your cctv camera setup, access it via your mobile phone.</p>
<blockquote><p>As a bonus, just in case you dont want your pc to be turned on all-day and all night just to monitor your house, you can buy a wireless ip camera and have it connected to your router</p></blockquote>
<p>let me know if you had any problem and enjoy! :-)</p>
