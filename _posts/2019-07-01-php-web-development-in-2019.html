This article is more of "how to think" like a modern PHP developer than "how to write" PHP. 
If you are like me who learned PHP 10 years ago (2009), the landscape and ecosystem is entirely different than today.<br/>

<h2>We dont call them "script" anymore, we call them "product" or "app"</h2>

<p>Before, whenever some functionality is needed, it is pretty common for people to look for a corresponding "script" for that
    <ul>
        <li>Do you have youtube clone script?</li>
        <li>Where could I buy a user management script?</li>
        <li>I have a script to optimize my site but it is broken</li>
    </ul>
You'll often read those kind of sentences in old forums, emails and conversations. 

Today, whenever a user needs some functionality, this is how they refer to it:<br/><br/>


<ul>
    <li>Is there an app that does this?</li>
    <li>What startup is offering this kind of product?</li>
    <li>How can we optimize this app?</li>
</ul>

If you are asking <i>What exactly means by app?</i>, you can check <b><a href="https://12factor.net/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Twelve Factor</a></b> to know what exactly is needed for an app to be an app.
</p>

<h2>Writing in "Core PHP" is not cool anymore</h2>

<p>First things first, a lot of people who calls themselve a "PHP Core Developer" is misusing the term "core"</p>
<p>What they THINK Core PHP means: <i> Writing scripts without using framework or libraries and only using core functions.</i></p>
<p>What does Core PHP REALLY means:<i> You are C or C++ programmer who is contributing to maintaining and optimization of  
    <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PHP Interpreter source code</a></i></p>

<p>Now, lets say we take the 1st context (writing in php without frameworks), the only situations you should be doing that are:
    <ul>
        <li>You have full mastery of ANY existing framework and you think you can write a better one</li>
        <li>You could comply with <a href="https://12factor.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">12 Factor App</a> without cutting corners and delaying your project timeline.</li>
        <li>You need to fix a bug or add a simple feature on a legacy application</li>
        <li>You are developing an SDK (libraries to interact with APIs) or Tools (Composer, PHPUnit)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>You should NOT be coding in "Core PHP" if:
    <ul>
        <li>You don't have understanding of how to build a good framework from scratch. Frameworks are unavoidable, it is either you use an existing one or unconsiously building one.</li>
        <li>You dont know how to use any existing framework or library</li>
        <li>You dont know what PSR is</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>We dont Copy-Paste PHP Classes anymore</h2>

<p>If you are guy who often browse <a href="https://www.phpclasses.org" target="blank" rel="nofollow">phpclasses.org</a> whenever you need something, 
    let me introduce you to <a href="https://packagist.org/"  target="blank" rel="nofollow">Packagist</a> and <a href="https://getcomposer.org/"  target="blank" rel="nofollow">Composer</a>
    Please know how to use those couple of tools and you'll see what I mean.
</p>

<h2>We dont use Filezilla to use edit files in live/production anymore</h2>

<p>This is a habit that is hard to break, specially if you are WordPress Developer. But hey, check the concepts of <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/what-is-continuous-integration-andontinuous-delive"  target="blank" rel="nofollow">Continous Integration and Delivery</a>. And if you are a WP developer, please check <a href="https://roots.io/"  target="blank" rel="nofollow">Roots.io</a>

<p>There you have it! Sorry if you are expecting some cool PHP syntax, but if that is what you are looking for, I have a <a href="/php-features-you-rarely-use-1">post</a> for that :)</p>
