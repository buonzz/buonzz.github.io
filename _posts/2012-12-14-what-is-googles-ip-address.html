<p>We already know that IP address is a series of numbers that identifies a particular computer. You might be wondering what is the IP address of a website that is so common and we use almost everyday.</p>
<p>Although there is some uncertainty of what particular IP address is being used by Google and all it's related services, we are sure that its just within a particular range. Thus, I will give you that IP range.<br />
<!--more--><br />
IP range is a set of IPs, with a lower bound and upper bound, much like of a numbers like 1 to 10. When you say 1 to 10, you are not actually giving a particular number, but a set of numbers which is greater than or equal to 1 but less than or equal to 10.</p>
<p>That best describes the IP of Google, it is not just one particular IP, but a range of IP address. The table below indicates the complete range of IP address that Google is using in all of its related services. (Google App Engine, Google Drive, Gmail etc).</p>
<ul>
<li>216.239.32.0 - 216.239.63.255</li>
<li>64.233.160.0 - 64.233.191.255</li>
<li>66.249.80.0 - 66.249.95.255</li>
<li>72.14.192.0 - 72.14.255.255</li>
<li>209.85.128.0 - 209.85.255.255</li>
<li>66.102.0.0 - 66.102.15.255</li>
<li>74.125.0.0 - 74.125.255.255</li>
<li>64.18.0.0 - 64.18.15.255</li>
<li>207.126.144.0 - 207.126.159.255</li>
<li>173.194.0.0 - 173.194.255.255</li>
</ul>
<p>There you go, use it on whatever purpose it may serve in you.<br />
One of the uses cases of this is, when you are writing some Google related service, like Google App Engine, and you want Google to be able to connect to your server without exposing your server to the cloud. You can then use those IP to whitelist Google and its all related services so that you are sure that it is Google indeed is the only one making requests to your service.</p>
