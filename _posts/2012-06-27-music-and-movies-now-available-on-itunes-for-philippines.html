<p>When I open up my iTunes, something weird I noticed was  my iTunes menu has 2 new item on it</p>
<p><a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/itunes-menus.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-454" title="itunes-menus" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/itunes-menus.png" alt="" width="484" height="80" /></a></p>
<p>Not sure if it's only me, but as far as I know Music and Movies was not available to Philippines since I started using iTunes. Then suddenly it became available out of nowhere.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elegantthemes.com/affiliates/idevaffiliate.php?id=18466_0_1_7" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/468x60.gif" width="468" height="60" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The availability of each iTune product is listed in this Apple Support page:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ts3599">http://support.apple.com/kb/ts3599</a></p>
<p>which clearly says that Movies and Music is not available to Philippines</p>
<p><a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/apple-support.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-455" title="apple-support" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/apple-support.png" alt="" width="982" height="816" /></a></p>
<p>So not sure what the heck happened on iTunes why they are now offering this in Philippines.</p>
<p>I'm fairly sure that my Country setting is set to Philippines</p>
<p><a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/phils.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-456" title="phils" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/phils.png" alt="" width="1090" height="307" /></a></p>
<p>As well as I'm sure that I'm sure that I'm using an iTunes account that is registered for Philippines. So in short, yeah it is confirmed, Music and Movies are now available in Philippines.</p>

<p>For those people that didn't know, Music and Videos was not available "legally" to Philippines, there were some limitations for each country as to what item they can purchase in their iTunes accounts ( see <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ts3599">http://support.apple.com/kb/ts3599</a> )</p>
<p>Before, people who wants to buy a music/album/movie  that is only available to U.S. has no option to get it legally via iTunes except from buying it via Gift Cards bought in U.S.</p>
<p>I know there is a bunch of things/method you can do to download mp3 and videos to your iOS device of course, but what I'm telling at this point is acquiring it, legally buying it from within iTunes.</p>
<p>Whether this is just a technical glitch or was a change in policy in copyrights by Apple, this is good to know that we can now support those artists that we love by buying their albums in iTunes.</p>
