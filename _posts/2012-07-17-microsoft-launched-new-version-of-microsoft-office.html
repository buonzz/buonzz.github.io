Thus, most user are starting to use Google Docs and other web-based services to store documents and stuffs.<br />
In response to this scenario, Microsoft tried to augment its launch of tablet by providing softwares that will actually support it and makes it easier to use.<br />
This new version of Microsoft Office is more of usage for the Windows 8 OS. An OS geared toward tablet computing, and basically one of the pieces of puzzle that Microsoft needs to do in able to cope up with the ever changing trend of technology.</p>
