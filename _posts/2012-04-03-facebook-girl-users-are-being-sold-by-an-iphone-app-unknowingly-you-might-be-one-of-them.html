<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a big issue exploded on the internet when online privacy advocates questioned the "purpose" of the iPhone app:</p>
<p><b>Girls Around Me</b><br />
http://www.girlsaround.me/</p>
<p>This application collects data about "girls" in the Facebook, Twitter etc. including their location, pictures and other data that is publicly available whether it is from the post, tweets, profile and etc.<br />
But, to clarify the act, what the app is doing is legal.</p>
<p>The problem is, most of the users, specially girls of social networking sites were unaware of the things they publish on the web. This includes the bikini pictures you have on your summer vacation, your personal pictures on your room  etc.<br />
<a href="http://www.darwinbiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Screen_shot_2012-03-30_at_3.49.17_PM.png"><img src="assets/Screen_shot_2012-03-30_at_3.49.17_PM.png" alt="" title="Screen_shot_2012-03-30_at_3.49.17_PM" width="286" height="433" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-176" /></a></p>
<p>As those pictures are being gathered by the www.girlsaround.me site, they are being sold as the primary feature of the app, so that anyone who has that app in their iPhone can trace which girl is the nearest to your location -- a perfect tool for 50 year old man who is on hunt for young girls.</p>
<p>As the legalities of the usage of the data is not really off-the-rule, Since only those publicly available data are being gathered, this scenario provokes each every person (specially girls) who uses social networking sites to be careful of what they are posting on the internet, specially the privacy settings involved with those posts.</p>
<p>While it is perfectly cool to showcase your bikini suit in your Facebook profile, it is very disgusting to see your picture posted in a adult oriented site or alike.</p>
