<blockquote>Your Google Play registration payment was denied.<br />
We had a problem processing your credit card. Please go to Google Checkout to fix the problem or please submit a new registration order.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are familiar with the above message. It simply means you just had lost $25.<br />
Yes, up to now, there is no solution to that. Google wont pay you back the $25 fee that was charged to you, even they said nothing is charged in your credit card.</p>

At the time of writing, there is no definite fix or solution that Google have on this particular issue.</p>
<p>Some might say:</p>
<ul>
<li>You should contact your bank</li>
<li>You should send your scanned id to Google to verify</li>
<li>You should fill some form that will make its way to Google</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>Believe me, none of them will work. I tried it myself.</p>
<p>First question you might ask is, why?</p>
<p>One of the most probable reason because of Google's internal problem with <em>Google Wallet</em><br />
When you need to pay the $25 fee for your Developer Account, you need to use Google Wallet. The problem is, Google Wallet itself has a big problem</p>

<p>There been a massive security hole on that thing, that Google locks out all the money that gone through Google Wallet. It is not that there is some problem with your credit card, they are holding it, since they fear of reimbursing the money to the hackers. </p>
<p>In conclusion, Google locks your $25 money, simply because Google Wallet failed.</p>
