<p>There might be times that you need to execute MongoDB commandsÂ via command line. One of the obvious reason for this is latency -- unlike hitting the MongoDB server across the network, executing the commands via shell is way very fast, specially if you are retrieving/processing huge amount of data.</p>
<p>Fortunately, MongoDB supports Server Side scripting, using JavaScript as programming language. It is as easy as creating a .js file in your server. In this tutorial, lets create a create_record.js file that will do the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect to local MongoDB server</li>
<li>Create a database with name db1</li>
<li>Create a collection named "greetings"</li>
<li>Create a new record with the property "message" and value of "Hello World"</li>
<li>Print a status message</li>
</ul>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/buonzz/de6ddcef66367270e847.js"></script>TO execute the file:<script src="https://gist.github.com/buonzz/2a8ab5b7ef75ec37537a.js"></script></p>
<p>This will connect to localhost, in port 27017. Selecting the database "db1", then executing the create_record.js file.</p>
<p>That is how simple how to execute a JavaScript file in the server-side!</p>
