<h3>One-line installation</h3>

<p>Want to develop in MeteorJS? sure just paste this in your console and everything you need to get started is all set:</p>

<code>
	curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
</code>

<p>
Compare that to other on which you need to install wamp, xampp, mysql, php extensions, java, rvm, ruby, python, NodeJS, virtualbox, vagrant, gulp, so on and so forth. It is just way too much and pain in the ass, while in MeteorJS, is just a matter of simply copy-pasting that one line of code and you are done.
</p>


<h3>Project creation and management is very simple</h3>

<p>Want to create a new project?</p>

<code>
	meteor create-project myproject
</code>

<p>Want to run the project?</p>
{% highlight bash %}
	cd myproject
	meteor
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Want to reset data of the project?</p>

<code>
	meteor reset
</code>

<p>
The commands are very intuitive and really easy to remember. Nothing is been easier than that if you compare the workflow to other frameworks.
