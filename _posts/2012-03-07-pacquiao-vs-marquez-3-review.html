<p>It's been a long wait before finally the third fight had occured between these two great warriors. The result however is not what everyone wants to see:</p>
<p>Pacquiao did not succesfully knocked-out Marquez, he did not even won the fight decisively.</p>
<p>Marquez have not won the judges scorecard. He did either not get pacman knocked out ( he said he is looking for a knock-out before the fight)Â  and a lot of Mexicans are disappointed on the results.</p>
<p>Who should had won? Pacquiao.</p>
<p>Pacquiao is the depending champion, he could actually just sit there and just play it safe. It's marquez who needs to prove something.</p>
<p>The ironic part is, Marquez is not aggressive enough to get the belt. He is just waiting for the chance to counter-punch. This is not an ideal way to get a belt, you need to be aggressive and make the opponent lose convicingly. That's the mistake on Marquez's end --- He lacks offense.</p>
<p>I'm a Pacquiao fan, and I do believe, technically, Marquez is better than Pacquiao specially in ring IQ and strategy.</p>
<p>But this a thing I'm believing into:<br />
"You should beat someone on what he does best, before you could declare yourself greater than him"</p>
<p>Pacquiao's style is not a technical fighter. neither a counter-puncher. If Marquez wants to prove something, beat Mayweather, because he is the best in counter-punching. If you want to prove that you had beaten pacquiao, beat him in a slugfest, because that is what Pacquiao does best. --- power to power.</p>
