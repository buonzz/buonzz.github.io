<blockquote>
Why many of things taught in school can't be used in real life? 
</blockquote>

<p>A large percentage of people I interact with, specially in my country (Philippines) has this feedback about educational institutions lacking the ability to prepare people to "actual" real-life challenges you'll be needing in an actual Information Technology work. Whether this is really true - I don't know, as I did not (or wasn't even capable of) conducting a more in-depth study about the subject matter. But what follows is just purely opinionated point of view of mine about the subject matter (so I might be wrong in some things and I might be correct in some)</p> 

<h3>Social Status</h3>
<p>Whether you are in a poverty line or in middle class - that largely defines how relevant a certain topic of interest to you. For example a person which has a family that barely has something to eat will most likely think subject about Physics, Trigonometry and Algorithm doesn't makes sense.</p>

<p>IT Industry offers way larger salary than most of other industry, and also offers you the ability to work remotely, that is why many people in poverty line is motivated to go with this route, as for many - its a sure ticket out of poverty.</p>
