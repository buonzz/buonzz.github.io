<p>PHP 7 was just released. But this doesn't means all hosting provider will quickly jump into putting PHP 7 in all of your legacy sites.
Imagine the horror if suddenly you have to refactor your 10-year old legacy site while you are in the middle of developing another project.</p>
<p>If you are developing some PHP site, what you can do right now though is to be aware how to write a PHP 7 compliant codes. So that you wont have to refactor it later when the time comes that your organization is ready for PHP 7. Here is some tips on how to make a PHP 7 compatible codes:</p> 


<h3>Don't use Alternative PHP Tags</h3>
<p>Things like</p>

<code>
<script language="php"> 
// Code here
</script>
</code>

and 

<code>
<%  %>
<%=$varToEcho; %>
</code>


<h3>Don't use POSIX-Compatible Regular Expressions</h3>
<p>The entire ext/ereg is removed. Avoid using these functions in your new projects</p>

<ul>
<li>ereg()</li>
<li>eregi()</li>
<li>ereg_replace()</li>
<li>eregi_replace()</li>
<li>split()</li>
<li>spliti()</li>
<li>sql_regcase()</li>
</ul>

<h3>Don't use the ext/mysql extension functions</h3>
<p>This is easy to spot - all those mysql_* functions that you are used to. Don't use those anymore, they are completely removed in PHP 7. Few examples are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>mysql_connect</li>
	<li>mysql_query</li>
	<li>mysql_fetch_assoc</li>
</ul>


<p>There are lot of new features that comes with PHP 7 and I wont re-iterate those in here. This is more of "survival kit" post so your code is guaranteed to run when the time comes that you need to run it in PHP 7.</p>

<p>Those are the "must" when you writing PHP code right now and from this point forward and its up to you if you want to leverage the other new features of PHP 7.</p>
