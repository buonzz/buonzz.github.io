* Sim Card and MicroSD card is not easily installable
* green blinking text turns on right away as soon as you plug the battery
* 2,499.00 (around $54) - not cheap.
* feels like a small cellphone (without screen), identical like batteries, simcard and sd card placement
* the handle like thing is its gps antenna
